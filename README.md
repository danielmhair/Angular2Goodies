# Prepare Angular 2 App for Production using Angular CLI

## 1. Run `ng build --env=prod`
After this, your production files will be locations in a dist folder. 
This command will convert all your js, css and html files and minify 
them into relatively few files.

## 2. Serve the `dist` folder
You need to serve the files in the `dist` folder from your server.
